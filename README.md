<h1>Let's start</h1>

While you're reading this text everything has already changed :). New network appeared, new search engine has been created, new boolean operator's been invented.
That is what I love about **talent sourcing**, everyday you have anything new to learn and discover. 
Here are a few reasons why I decided to create this rep:
<ol>
  <li>That is fun to use (so-to-say) the main tool of R&D teams;</li>
  <li>That definately helps to understand how it works;</li>
  <li>Boolean strings are the sort of technical art for me;</li>
  <li>There're so many new undiscovered sources we can learn together and share our best-working x-ray strings for them.</li>
</ol>

 Hope to see your brilliant examples as well!
